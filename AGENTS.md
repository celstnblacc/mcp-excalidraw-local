# AGENTS.md

Agent instructions for excalidraw-mcp-sentinel. Read this before starting any task.

## What This Is

A hardened, self-hosted Excalidraw MCP server (`excalidraw-mcp-sentinel`). Single Node.js/TypeScript process
running an MCP server (stdio, 32 tools), an Express+WebSocket canvas server, and
SQLite persistence with multi-tenancy. Forked from [sanjibdevnathlabs/mcp-excalidraw-local](https://github.com/sanjibdevnathlabs/mcp-excalidraw-local).

## Commands

```bash
# Install
npm ci

# Build (frontend + server)
npm run build

# Build server only (TypeScript)
npm run build:server

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Tests
npm test                        # full suite (vitest, 369 tests)
npm run test:api                # API tests only
npm run test:ws                 # WebSocket tests only

# Run canvas server
node dist/server.js

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Architecture

```
src/index.ts    MCP server (stdio) — 32 tools, HTTP client to canvas
src/server.ts   Express canvas server — REST API, WebSocket, Zod validation
src/security.ts Security middleware — auth, CORS, rate limiting, sanitization
src/db.ts       SQLite persistence — CRUD, FTS5, migrations, tenants
src/types.ts    Shared TypeScript types, ID generation, element validation
frontend/       React + Excalidraw UI (Vite, output → dist/frontend/)
```

Data flow: MCP tool → `index.ts` → HTTP → `server.ts` → SQLite + WS broadcast → frontend.

## Key Constraints

- **ESM only** — all imports use `.js` extension. Do not use `require()`.
- **Strict TypeScript** — `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` enabled. No `any` without justification.
- **No `===` on secrets** — use `crypto.timingSafeEqual`. See `src/security.ts`.
- **Validation before DB write** — always validate element types against `VALID_ELEMENT_TYPES` before persisting.
- **Logger after validation** — never access `req.body` fields in logger calls before the array/type checks run (crash risk).
- **Auth env vars read at request time** — `security.ts` reads `process.env` on each call so tests can mutate env between cases. Do not cache `process.env.EXCALIDRAW_API_KEY`.
- **Canvas sync is fire-and-forget** — MCP handlers call canvas REST but never fail if canvas is down. Use `syncToCanvas()`.
- **Logging to file only** — never log to stdout (breaks MCP stdio JSON protocol). Use the Winston logger in `src/utils/logger.ts`.

## Security Middleware (`src/security.ts`)

All middleware lives here — do not duplicate in routes:
- `helmetMiddleware` — security headers
- `corsMiddleware` — explicit origin allowlist (env: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`)
- `apiKeyAuth` — timing-safe API key check (env: `EXCALIDRAW_API_KEY`)
- `sanitizeBody` — strips `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` keys
- `validateMermaidInput` — caps diagram size at 50 KB
- `generalRateLimit` / `destructiveRateLimit` / `writeBurstLimit` — 3-tier rate limiting
- `requireConfirm` — requires `?confirm=true` on destructive endpoints
- `verifyWsClient` — WS origin check at upgrade time
- `sanitizeSearchQuery` / `InvalidSearchQueryError` — FTS input sanitization

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `CANVAS_PORT` | `3000` | Canvas server port |
| `EXCALIDRAW_API_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Enables API key auth on all `/api/*` routes |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3000,...` | Comma-separated CORS allowlist |
| `EXCALIDRAW_DB_PATH` | `$HOME/.excalidraw-mcp/excalidraw.db` | SQLite path |
| `EXCALIDRAW_EXPORT_DIR` | `process.cwd()` | Export directory (path traversal guard) |
| `EXCALIDRAW_RATE_LIMIT_GENERAL_MAX` | `100` | Requests per 15-minute window |
| `EXCALIDRAW_RATE_LIMIT_DESTRUCTIVE_MAX` | `10` | Requests per 1-minute window |
| `EXCALIDRAW_RATE_LIMIT_WRITE_BURST_MAX` | `10` | Sync writes per 1-minute window |

## Testing Rules

- 369 tests across 20 files — all must pass before any commit.
- New security-relevant behaviour must have a regression test.
- Tests mutate `process.env` between cases — do not cache env values at module init.
- Integration tests use real SQLite (tmpdir). Do not mock the DB.

## Similar Project Scan

- Use `npm run scan:similar-projects` to scan GitHub for architecturally similar Excalidraw projects.
- The scanner is capability-based, not fork-based: it looks for Excalidraw plus MCP, backend sync, persistence, security, workspace isolation, and self-hosting signals.
- When looking for broader competitors instead of this repo's own lineage, run:

```bash
npm run scan:similar-projects -- \
  --exclude-repo yctimlin/mcp_excalidraw \
  --exclude-repo sanjibdevnathlabs/mcp-excalidraw-local \
  --exclude-repo artificemachine/excalidraw-mcp-sentinel
```

- Reports are written to `docs/generated/` as JSON and Markdown.
- For repeated or larger scans, prefer setting `GITHUB_TOKEN` to avoid GitHub anonymous API rate limits.
- Rerun the scan after significant product or architecture changes. Changes to MCP features, persistence, security, or backend topology can materially change which repos are the closest matches.
- Reference docs:
  - `docs/GUIDE-excalidraw-similar-project-search.md`
  - `docs/AUDIT-excalidraw-similar-project-scan.md`
  - `docs/COMPARISON-excalidraw-top-repos.md`

## Protected Files

- `AGENTS.md` — immutable unless explicitly named in the request.
- `CLAUDE.md` — immutable unless explicitly named in the request.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — append-only. Never edit or reorder existing entries.

## Before `npm publish`

- [ ] Bump `version` in `package.json` (current: `1.0.0`)
- [ ] `npm test` → 369/369
- [ ] `npm run build` → zero errors
- [ ] `shipguard scan .` → 0 CRITICAL
- [ ] `npm publish --dry-run` → only `dist/`, `skills/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE` included

## Strict Installation Decoupling

Once installed (e.g., to ~/.local/bin), the project binary must NEVER depend on the local repository path for execution, configuration, or data. All paths must be relative to the installation root or use standard system config paths (~/.config).
